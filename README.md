My Modular JavaScript Library


## Overview ##

This is a collection of JavaScript *objects*/*helpers*/*methods* created for personal use.

It was created to be used when only some specific features are required avoiding the use of a full bloated frameworks if it isn't necessary.

It was also created because I don't agree with some frameworks APIs and the coding style that they "enforce".

The main goals of this library is to:

 - be modular;
 - be clear;
 - be easy to debug;
 - be easy to maintain;
 - follow best practices;
 - follow standards when possible;
 - **don't try to convert JavaScript into another language!**
 - be compatible with other frameworks;
 - be simple;
 - be small;
 - fully documented;

It was heavily inspired by other frameworks and other people work/articles/ideas and they're are properly credited on the source code. Just to cite a few of them:

 - [Nicholas C. Zackas](http://nczonline.net/)
 - [Peter-Paul Koch](http://www.quirksmode.org/)
 - [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 - [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)
 - [YUI3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/)
 - [Thomas Fuchs](http://mir.aculo.us/)

PS: Probably I won't implement most of the features that exist on the major frameworks.


## Should I use it? ##

This library was designed for *intermediate* to *advanced* JavaScript developers, if you're starting with JavaScript development I recommend using a framework that you can easily find tutorials on the internet, such as [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [MooTools](http://mootools.net) and [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/).

If you're building desktop-like applications it's better to use a JavaScript Framework that already has GUI widgets. Check the [comparison list of JavaScript frameworks on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) to know the differences between each framework.

This library was created mainly to be used on small to medium web sites.


## Important ##

 - **This Library is on an early beta state and no proper testing was done (bugs are expected).**
 - All code here is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) unless otherwise noted.
 - I don't give any kind of support on how to use these files.
 - Files/Folders may disappear. APIs may change. Things may break.
 - Almost everything is a work in progress.
 - This library is only intended to work on well-formed HTML files, so always use the proper doctype (strict or transitional) and validade your HTML/XHTML.
 - Some functionalities may not work properly on specific mobile devices.
 - I will only test the code on the latest non-beta version of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and also IE6+.
